  "description": "*  - React *  - ReactDOM *  - TypeScript *  - Redux *  - Redux Toolkit *  - React-hook-form: https://react-hook-form.com/api/useformcontext/ *  - - The library aims to provide users with a smoother interaction experience by fine-tuning the performance and improving accessibility. Some of the performance enhancements include: *  - - - Introducing form state subscription model through the proxy *  - - - Avoiding unnecessary computation *  - - - Isolating component re-rendering when required *  - - Overall, it improves the user experience while users interact with the application. As for the developers, we introduce built-in validation and are closely aligned with HTML standards allowing further extension with powerful validation methods and integration with schema validation natively. In addition, having a strongly type-checked form with the help of typescript provides early build-time feedback to help and guide the developer to build a robust form solution.",
